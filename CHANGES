    - Iterating over a row now yields instances of a new Cell class, rather
      than the actual data. The Cell objects tries to behave as smartly as
      possible to accommodate most use cases, but some code may very well
      break. The appropriate fix will likely be acccessing the raw data
      using ``cell_instance.data``.
